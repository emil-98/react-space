# Space content app

This is a simple app I wrote using React and Node mostly as a way to demonstrate some ui and backend skills. The frontend receives an image from NASA's astronomy pic of the day API which is queried from a node backend. 

I couldn't find an easy way to use Vite as the dev server for a React and Express project, so I did some searching and found [this](https://noam.hashnode.dev/using-vite-to-serve-and-hot-reload-react-app-express-api-together) blog by Noam Honig, which contains some scripts that make everything run smoothly for development.
