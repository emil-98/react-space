# Vite + React + Node
### With Tailwind CSS

This is a template project I stumbled across while looking for a simple way to develop React + Node apps using Vite as a dev server.

This method was found on [Noam Honig's Blog](https://noam.hashnode.dev/using-vite-to-serve-and-hot-reload-react-app-express-api-together).

One great thing about this setup is that everything can be installed to the root directory and there is only one package.json

I did my best to explain how the modified files work using comments. 

See the express-plugin.js file for more info.
